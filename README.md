# Face Tracking and Object Localization Project

This project focuses on developing a robust face tracking and object localization system using deep learning techniques. It involves the creation of a custom model, data preparation, training, and evaluation to achieve accurate face tracking and object localization.

## Project Overview

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

- Develop a system for accurate face tracking and object localization.
- Utilize deep learning techniques, including a custom model architecture.
- Create and curate a dataset for training and evaluation.
- Implement custom loss functions for improved performance.
- Prepare the model for real-time applications and deployment.

## Key Components

The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Data Collection: Collect a dataset of images containing faces and objects of interest.
   - Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity and quality of the dataset.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Feature Extraction: Utilize a pre-trained VGG16 model to extract image features.
   - Classification Branch: Design a branch for classifying the presence of faces or specific objects.
   - Localization Branch: Create a branch for predicting the coordinates of bounding boxes.

3. **Loss Functions**:
   - Classification Loss: Implement binary cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.
   - Localization Loss: Develop a custom localization loss function for accurate object localization.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train and fine-tune the custom `FaceTracker` model using a dataset of images and labels.
   - Implement batch processing for efficient model training.
   
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the model's performance through testing and validation.
   - Evaluate classification accuracy and localization precision.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Create the necessary directory structure to organize your data. You should have the following folders in your project directory:

    ```
    - data
      - images
      - labels
      - test
        - images
        - labels
      - train
        - images
        - labels
      - val
        - images
        - labels
    - aug_data
      - test
        - images
        - labels
      - train
        - images
        - labels
      - val
        - images
        - labels
    ```

   You will place your images and labels for training, testing, and validation in their respective folders. Additionally, the `aug_data` directory is where augmented data will be stored during training.

3. Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies, including TensorFlow and OpenCV.

4. Customize the model architecture and loss functions to suit your specific application.

5. Train the model using your dataset and fine-tune it for optimal performance.

6. Evaluate the model's performance and make any necessary adjustments.

7. Prepare the model for real-time applications or deployment.

Remember to populate the `images` and `labels` folders with the relevant data as required by your project. This directory structure is essential for the project to work properly.
